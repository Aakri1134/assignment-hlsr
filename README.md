## About the Project
I spent approximately 7 hours on coding the project, distributed over a duration of three days. 
Most of the time was spent on designing the UI for the app, I went for color scheme of navy blue, orange and white resembling the famous oxford dictionary, matching the theme of the app.
The time spent on coding functionalities was minimum as most of them were fairly straight forward.
For better performance, I also integrated certain features for lesser wait time on actual searching.

## Future Plans
I plan on making suggestions based on previous searches from the user.
Also features like generating a history of previous searches and feature to bookmark searches could also a possibility.
