## Leveraging AI in Front-End Delivery
I'd use AI coding/design assistants to ship front-end features faster without sacrificing quality. 
For example, 
I’d use ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot or Claude to make React components like modals or cards using frameworks like Tailwind, saving hours on repetitive codes. 

To ensure reliability, I’d auto-generate unit tests using AI with tools like Testing Library, covering edge cases that might be missed in a rush.

For designing , I could use Figma-to-code tools (like Locofy or Anima) to turn designs into responsive React code, speeding up UI implementation.

For better and faster documentation process, I can use tools like Mintlify, this not only saves time but also make the documentation more readable and error free.
Even though AI might be much faster and effective than humans, but understanding the code written is very necessary for implementation and collaboration purposes especially in big tech projects.

## Inventing an AI Feature for Class 11 Students

The App/Website would be a questionnaire based revision platform, as from personal experience, questions are the best way of revising topics. Basic features like bookmarking question, playlists, question banks for topics, timed mock tests with detailed topic-wise analysis would also be provided. The major AI features would be as follows-
 
 1. AI would be used in question selection and solving.The AI would pick questions based on the user's score in the topic and time between last revision of the topic.We would take photos or text as input and use AI to generate results for the question solving any related doubts.
 
 3. A Text to Speech model could be used to summarize and explain topics for revision purposes, where the student could converse with the model as if talking to a teacher.
### For User Flow
1. After authentication, the user will be brought to an onboarding screen.
 2. Here the user will enter the topics he/she has covered, and his/her confidence in them 
 3. Based on this input an initial questionnaire will be taken to present our product to the customer
 4. After this the user could be introduced to plans and perks
 5. Assuming a paid user, he/she will have a daily questionnaire section, with each question having all previously mentioned features. Apart from this features like Topic wise revision, mock tests, profile, and problem solving AI could be separate tabs as well.
